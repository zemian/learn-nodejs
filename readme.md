# my-ts-node

This project explore TypeScript using NodeJS env. We installed ts-node module so we can run TypeScript
on command line as well. We also setup '@types/node', so we can use it in .ts file to explore all NodeJS
modules. Note also that in "tsconfig.json", we have set TS compiler to generate "commonjs" .js code, which
will be runnable by node directly.

  npx tsc
