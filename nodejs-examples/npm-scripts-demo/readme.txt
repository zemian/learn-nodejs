A simple NodeJS+NPM based project

  npm install - install and download dependencies into node_modules folder.
  npm run hello

To learn more about package.json see
    https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json
    https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#main

We can use "npm" to execute most scripts within the project.
See https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts

    npm run-script <stage>
    npm run <stage>

For example:
    npm run hello # Our custom script
    npm start     # Run node server.js (if you have the file)
