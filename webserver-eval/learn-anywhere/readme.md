`anywhere` is a simple web server that can serve static file server anywhere. 

NOTE: This `anywhere` has even less dependencies (6) compare to `express` (30)! So it's much more simplier to study and use.

The main "dependency" to serve web content is the [`connect`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect)

## Run it

	npx anywhere
